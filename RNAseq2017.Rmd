## Applications for RNA-seq
- Identify gene sequences in genomes
- Investigate patterns of gene expression
- Study isoforms and allelic expression
- Learn about gene functions
- Identify co-expressed gene networks
- Identify SNPs in genes

## What makes RNA-seq different to genome sequencing
- Dynamic expression, which means that each tissue, time-point and cell will be different
- Most data comes from "functional units" eg. protein coding genes
- Smaller sequence space as it is a subset of the complete genome

## High-level RNA-seq workflow
- Experimental design (biology, medicine, statistics)
- RNA Extraction (biology, biotechnology)
- Library preparation (biology, biotechnology)
- Sequencing (engineering, chemistry, physics, biotechnology and bioinformatics)
- <div class="red"> Data processing (bioinformatics)</div>
- <div class="red"> Data analysis (bioinformatics, biostatistics, biology, medicine)</div>

## Type of data
- The actual sequence data is the same as for genome sequence data
- Both single- and pair-end data
- Major difference is that transcripts often comes from one strand and most data retain this structure eg. the sequence data is from only one strand.

# QC of sequence files

## Quality control of fastq files 
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(ShortRead)
fls <- dir("../DATA/p25", "SRR3222409_1.*", full=TRUE)
qaSummary <- ShortRead:::qa(fls, type="fastq")
fls
perCycle <- qaSummary[["perCycle"]]
```
```{r QC1, fig.height=5, dev.args = list(bg = 'transparent')}
ShortRead:::.plotCycleBaseCall(perCycle$baseCall)
```

## Quality control of fastq files
```{r QC2fig, height=5, dev.args = list(bg = 'transparent')}
ShortRead:::.plotCycleQuality(perCycle$quality)
```

## Filter and trim fastq data
Based on the QC results there are at times a need to filter "bad" data. For example:

- filter reads based on quality score, e.g. with avg. quality below 20 within 4-basepair wide sliding windows
- filter reads that after this are shorter than a given cut-off 
- remove unwanted sequences, e.g. adapter sequences or contaminants

## Tools for QC and trimming/filtering of fastq data
- fastQC (QC)
- Prinseq (QC and filtering)
- FastX-toolkit (QC and trimming/filtering)
- R, via ShortRead package (QC and trimming/filtering)  
- Trimmomatic (Trimming/filtering)
- Cutadapt (Trimming/filtering)

# Reference based expression analysis

## What do need for this
- Read data (fastq files)  
  From the sequencing machines
  
- Reference genome (fasta file)  
  The genome sequence of the species.
  
- Reference annotation (GTF/GFF files)  
  Where the genes located on the genome

aTrack2 <- AnnotationTrack(range = bamFiles[4], genome = gen, name = "Reads", chromosome = 2)

toPlot <- append(list(gat, GeneRegionTrack(gr)),aTrack2)
```
```{r plotmap, height=5, dev.args = list(bg = 'transparent')}
plotTracks(toPlot, from = 66670000, to = 66700000, sizes = c(10,10,200))

# De-novo assembly of transriptomes

## Why? 
- No reference genome available
- Identify novel transcripts (genes or splice variants)
- Identify fusion genes or transcription from unknown origin

## How?
- Assemble the transriptome from the generated short reads
- All useful methods rely on generating a structure called a de-bruijn graph that in this context aims at extenting k-mers in the short reads to longer unambiguous sequences corresponding to transcripts

## From short reads to isoforms
<div class="centered">

</div>

## Trinity
<div class="centered">
![](Images/trinity.png)
</div>

## Other useful tools
- SOAP-denovo 
- TRANS Oases
- Trans-ABYSS

## QC of de-novo assemblies
- How large fractino of reads can be mapped back to the assembly
- Total sequence length of all assembled sequences
- Number of trancripts generated
- Compare to related species with genome information
- Predict open reading frames and protein domains
- etc etc 

# RNA-seq for expression analysis

## From sequence to expression
- Read counts is a measure of expression level
- Many reads mapping to a genomic feature = high expression
- The expression can be quantified on any level eg. gene, transcript (isoforms), or exons.

## Counting reads | Reference based approach
<div class="centered">
![](Images/HTseq.png)
</div>

## Counting reads | de-novo assembly
- Map reads to the assembled transcriptome 
- Count reads mapping to the different transcripts that have been assembled.
- It is not as easy as it sound as transcripts can be very redundant and a read might map to multiple transcripts equally well.
- Tools available RSEM, (kallisto and salmon)

## Count matrix
<div class="centered">
![](Images/tableCounts.png)
</div>

## Counts to expression
- The counts depend on both the number of sequences generated from a samples and on the sequence length of the gene/transcript
- Counts per million (CPM) is used to take out the effect of sequence depth
- Reads per kilobasepair and million (RPKM, FPKM) also takes the lengh of genes into account
- Several other normalisations are available and is used to optimize power in detection of differential expression

## Detection of differential gene expression
- Read counts (and CPM etc) does not follow a normal distribution
- In most experiments few replicates are used, limited power unless we use model based analysis for detection of DE
- It is hence recommended to use softwares designed specifically for RNA-seq DE analysis

- Some useful tools: Cuffdiff (avoid), edgeR, DESeq2, limma

## normalisation to sequencing depth

dxd = estimateSizeFactors( dxd )

#############
## dispersion estimation to distinguish technical and biological variation (noise) from real effects on exon usage due to the different conditions

dxd = testForDEU( dxd )

dxd = estimateExonFoldChanges( dxd, fitExpToVar="condition")

```

## Exon use
```{r }
plotDEXSeq(dxr, "ENSMUSG00000017421", legend = TRUE, cex.axis = 1.2, cex = 1.3, lwd = 2)
```

## Summary
- Many different expertises needed for RNA-seq experiments 
- Think ahead, plan wisely, ask for help
- If your experimental design is wrong nothing will help
- Assess and try to improve the quality of raw reads use QC tools and talk to sequencing centre

## Summary | Reference based
- Map to genome and use available annotations
- Count reads and check that the majority map according to expectiations
- Does count summaries make sense?
- Use appropriate tools and software for detection of DE

## Summary | De-novo
- Use reference genome to guide it, if available
- Spend lots of time in assessing the results e.g. by comparing related species, looking at ORFs etc
- consider merging with other data sources
- Try multiple assemblers

## Gene expresssion

Ensure that your experimental design allows addressing the question of interest. More replicates translates into more power for differential gene expression and easier publication process
